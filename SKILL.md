  Guide to configure and use the PerfectPost MCP server to manage LinkedIn content directly
  from Claude Code. Use this skill whenever the user mentions PerfectPost, wants to read,
  analyze, or schedule LinkedIn posts, manage drafts, check publication statistics, get engagement
  data (likes, comments), or automate any LinkedIn content workflow. Trigger even if the user
  just says "LinkedIn" and seems to want data or scheduling help — this MCP is likely what they need.

# PerfectPost MCP — User Guide

PerfectPost exposes an MCP server that gives access to your LinkedIn posts: content, statistics, drafts, and scheduling. It connects in a single command from Claude Code.

## 1. Setup (one-time)

Add the MCP server to Claude Code with this command:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http --scope user \
  --client-id dnakgf4sbal93ukngisqgb3vo \
  --callback-port 6274 \
  perfectpost https://mcp.perfectpost.social/mcp
```

Both `--client-id` and `--callback-port` are required: the PerfectPost server does not support automatic OAuth client registration, and the callback port must be fixed (6274) to match the authorized redirect URLs.

**On first use**, type `/mcp` in Claude Code, select "Authenticate" to start the OAuth flow. Your browser will open for you to log in with your PerfectPost account. Once authenticated, the token is stored automatically.

> **Verify the server is added:**
> ```bash
> claude mcp list
> ```

## 3. Data Formats

Each post returns an object with these key fields:

```
urn          — LinkedIn identifier (e.g. "urn:li:share:123456789")
text         — plain text content of the post
date         — ISO publication date
type         — post type (nullable)
media        — media object: { type: "image"|"video"|"pdf"|"poll", url, thumbnailUrl }
favorite     — boolean
objective    — marketing objective: "tofu" | "mofu" | "bofu" | null
categories   — array of tags
latestStats  — metrics (see below)
```

### Performance metrics (`latestStats`)

All stat fields use the `num*` prefix and are **nullable**:

### Drafts (`get_draft` / `create_draft`)

```

### Profile (`get_linkedin_profile`)

Nested structure:
```
identity    — { firstname, lastname, email, headline, vanityName, profileUrl, summary, locale, timeZone }

## 4. Example Prompts

### Analyzing performance

```
Show me the statistics for my LinkedIn posts from last month.
Which posts performed best?
```

```
Give me a summary of my LinkedIn engagement over the last 3 months:
impressions, likes, comments. Present it as a table.
```

```
Who has engaged most with my recent posts?
```

### Writing and scheduling content

```
Write a LinkedIn post about [topic] in my style, based on my last 5 posts.
Create a draft and schedule it for tomorrow at 9am.
```

```
Here is an article I wrote: [text]. Turn it into a compelling LinkedIn post,
create the draft and schedule it for Friday at 8:30am.
```

### Content search and analysis

```
Find all my posts that mention [topic].
Which ones had the most engagement?
```

> **Tip**: `search_posts` does exact string matching — prefer specific keywords (`"ChatGPT"`, `"DeepSeek"`) over generic terms (`"AI"`). Run multiple searches with different keywords for full coverage.

## 5. Usage Tips

**For scheduling**, always specify the desired date and time. The field to set in `schedule_draft` is `programmingDate` (ISO date).

**For statistics**, you can request comparisons over any period: "last month vs the month before", "this year", "the last 30 days". Key metrics are `numImpressions`, `numLikes`, `numComments`, `engagementRate`.

**To create content in your style**, start by reading your recent posts (`list_posts` + `get_post`) before generating a new draft — this produces much better results.

**Media**: if you want to attach an image to a draft, host it somewhere and give the URL to Claude — it will use `set_draft_media_from_url`. Supported types are `image`, `video`, `pdf`, and `images` (gallery).

**Marketing objectives**: you can tag your posts with a `tofu` (awareness), `mofu` (consideration), or `bofu` (conversion) objective — useful for filtering and analyzing by funnel stage.

## 6. Troubleshooting

**"Unauthorized" / expired token**: restart Claude Code, the token will be renewed automatically.

**Server doesn't appear in `claude mcp list`**: re-run the installation command from step 1.

**Stats not loading**: verify that your LinkedIn account is connected to PerfectPost at [perfectpost.social](https://perfectpost.social).
